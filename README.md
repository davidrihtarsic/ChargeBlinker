# ChargeBlinker

"Charge Blinker" device is suitable for laboratory work on topics related to electric current and resistance, as it allows the visualization of electric current. The "Blinker" is well suited for all levels of education, if the activities are carefully selected. However, despite other devices used for measuring and estimating electric current, the "Blinker" can be assembled by middle and high school teachers or students. The device supports the conceptual development of knowledge and can be used to integrate knowledge about electricity across subjects.
